    "# Evaluation Question Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook originally contained 99 evaluation questions across three difficulty levels:\n",
    "- **33 Easy Questions**: Simple queries testing basic filtering and aggregation\n",
    "- **33 Medium Questions**: Multi-condition queries with grouping and calculations  \n",
    "- **33 Hard Questions**: Complex multi-step analysis with advanced pandas operations\n",
    "- **20+ Out-of-Scope Questions**: Testing the system's ability to recognize limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation dataset was created following a systematic approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schema Analysis**: Reviewed all dataset columns and relationships\n",
    "2. **Pattern Identification**: Identified common analytical query patterns\n",
    "3. **Complexity Progression**: Questions ranged from simple counts to complex statistical analysis\n",
    "4. **Natural Language Variation**: Tested different phrasings and question formats\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Question Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy Level Examples\n",
    "- Count operations: \"How many orders do we have?\"\n",
    "- Simple filters: \"Show me orders by customer\"\n",
    "- Basic aggregations: \"What is the total revenue?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Medium Level Examples  \n",
    "- Conditional filtering: \"Which customers have more than 100 orders?\"\n",
    "- Date-based analysis: \"How many orders were placed in January?\"\n",
    "- Grouped calculations: \"Average order value by region\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hard Level Examples\n",
    "- Multi-step analysis: \"For each customer, average quantity per product\"\n",
    "- Statistical queries: \"Regions with >50% express shipping\"\n",
    "- Complex conditions: \"Orders with more than 5 different products\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Out-of-Scope Examples\n",
    "- Missing data: \"How many cancelled orders?\" (no cancellation field)\n",
    "- Wrong timeframe: \"Show orders from 2018\" (data starts 2024)\n",
    "- Non-existent values: Questions about data not in the dataset\n",
