# Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks for development, experimentation, and analysis.

## Structure

- **`benchmarking/`** - Agent performance evaluation and benchmarking
- **`custom_pandas_agent/`** - Custom pandas agent development experiments
- **`data_loading/`** - Data loading and preprocessing prototypes
- **`EDA/`** - Exploratory data analysis
- **`Evaluation/`** - Evaluation dataset and methodology
- **`Experimentation/`** - Various architectural experiments

## Purpose

These notebooks were used during development for:
- Prototyping agent components
- Testing data analysis workflows
- Evaluating system performance
- Exploring the dataset

## Note

These are **development artifacts**. For production code, see `/src/agents/`, `/src/tools/`, and `/src/streamlit/`.
